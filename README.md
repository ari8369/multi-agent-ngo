# multi-agent-sdg
This repository provides a multiagent simulation framework to analyze synergies and trade-offs between Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Each SDG is modeled as an autonomous agent coalition, with internal decision-making processes (inner-group voting) and interactions between SDGs (cross-group bargaining).
